Simple RSS feed reader tested with Jasmin. Exercise for [Udacity Front-End Web
Developer Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
The base code and resources for the exercise are from

## Instructions

To run, simply open the index.html file with your browser. The page loads
contents of one RSS feed automatically. To change the feed, click on the
menu icon on the upper left corner to pen a list of possible feeds.
Currently there are 4 feeds available for selection. Click one of them
to choose a new feed.

## Notes

At the bottom of the page there are a list of test cases that have been run on
the page. Besided the pre-defined test cases there are also tests for 
handling illegal id argument to the feed load function. Handler for those
errors has been also added to the function.
